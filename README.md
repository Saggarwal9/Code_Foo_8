# Code_Foo_8
Welcome to my repository containing the responses to Code_Foo 8.

Thank you for giving me an opportunity to apply. It has been really fun (and frustrating-- Thank you GEOMAGS -.- ) experience.  
I am personally happy with the quality of most of my submissions as I managed to do all of them while staying equally committed to my academics.

Sacrebleu! The Infinity War damaged a lot of worldwide monuments, including the Eiffel Tower. For some unknown reason (to be revealed in Infinity War 2), all we have left for building materials are Geomags™. The country of France has tasked you with building a new Eiffel Tower with Geomags™. About how many Geomags™ would you need? How would you build it? Describe each step in your thought process.

Response is in Rebuilding Eiffel Tower folder.

THE CHICKEN CROSSES THE ROAD  
Henny Penny, the chicken, wants to cross the road to go see his favorite historical documentary, Chicken Little. Although, the road often has potholes created by falling sky pieces. Chicken City doesn’t have enough corn in the budget to fix all the potholes, so Henny needs to be careful not to trip when crossing.

Program and explanation is in The Chicken Crosses the Road folder.
