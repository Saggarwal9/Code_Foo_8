### Why have I made a handwritten report?  
I found this question very interesting and it was extremely hard to implement and explain my thought process without writing.  
In my report, I've made sure to explain every step with details and have also included the assumptions and other procedures that I tried to use to solve this problem.  

This approach, however, isn't perfect. I've also explained some of the mistakes that I've made (which I was unable to come up with a way to rectify) which might lead to an over-use of GeoMags at some calculations.  

I've never seen or interacted with GeoMags in my life, so it took quite a bit of research to understand how they can be structured. However, I'm still not sure whether it's the correct way to go about it. 

**I know its a pretty long report, but I wanted to present you with every detail and thought process from my side.  
I hope you enjoy reading this report, like I enjoyed drafting it.**
