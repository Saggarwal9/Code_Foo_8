# Rebuilding the Eiffel Tower using Geomags

### Dimensions sources:

##### Eiffel Tower: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dimensions_tour_Eiffel_vi.PNG

### Why have I made a handwritten report?  
I found this question very interesting and it was extremely hard to implement and explain my thought process without writing.  
In my report, I've made sure to explain every step with details and have also included the assumptions and other procedures that I tried to use to solve this problem.  

This approach, however, isn't perfect. I've also explained some of the mistakes with my main approach which will lead to an overlap of GeoMags at some parts. (Trust me, I tried very hard to find a way around this.)    

I've never seen or interacted with GeoMags in my life, so it took quite a bit of research to understand how they can be structured. However, I'm not sure whether my understanding is accurate or not.  

**I know its a pretty long report, but I wanted to present you with every detail and thought process from my side.  
I hope you enjoy reading this report, like I enjoyed drafting it.** 

### Final Solution:
#### Geomag Rods: 28,095,223,820 rods
#### Geomag Magnetic balls/spheres: 11,238,892,610 balls
